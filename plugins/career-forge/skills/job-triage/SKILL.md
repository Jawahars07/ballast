description: Turn a raw list of job postings into a short, honest short-list by screening the requirements block for hard gates before anything reaches the digest. Use when triaging scraped or pasted postings, refreshing a pipeline, or producing a daily job digest. Screens on stated requirements only, never on responsibilities.

# Job Triage

Raw postings in, a short-list of two or three worth real effort out — plus an auditable record
of what got screened out and why.

This skill does not scrape. Bring it postings from wherever you get them: an export, a board, a
pasted list, an ATS API. It does the judging.

## Load first

- `profile.yml` — target archetypes, exclusions, location rule, granted exceptions
- `applications.tsv` — so nothing already tracked resurfaces
- A dedup history file, if you keep one

## Steps

### 1. Coarse filter

Drop, before reading anything closely:

- Seniority mismatches. A search for apprentice roles should never surface "Senior Staff X"
- Excluded functions from `profile.yml`
- Locations outside the commutable zone, unless `profile.yml` grants that role an exception
- Anything already in `applications.tsv` at any status

If results look suspiciously global, your location filter has broken. Check it before blaming
the source.

### 2. The requirements-block screen

For each survivor, fetch the posting and read the **requirements block only**: "Requirements",
"Your profile", "Qualifications", "Profil recherché", "Type d'études", "À propos de toi".

Apply `jd-analyser`'s hard gates:

| Gate | Kill signal in the requirements block |
|---|---|
| Degree field | Names a field the candidate does not hold |
| Specialised school | Names a school type they are not in, as an exclusive |
| Stated language | "fluent French", "proficiency in X", "bilingual" above their level |
| Hard tool bar | A named tool listed as *required* with no evidence in `facts.md` |
| Location | Outside the zone with no exception granted |

**A gate hit means the role does not enter the digest.** Log it under a `Screened out` section
with the one-line reason, so every decision the filter made stays auditable and the user can
overrule any of them.

**Read the requirements block, never the responsibilities.** Three roles in a row once had
responsibilities matching the candidate well and were each disqualified by a gate.
Responsibilities describe the job. Requirements decide whether you can hold it.

**Only the stated bar counts.** A posting written in French that names no French requirement
does not get a French gate. Never infer a language bar from the posting's language or the
company's country.

### 3. Rank the survivors

By archetype fit from `profile.yml`. Note contract length where the posting states it.

### 4. Write the digest

```markdown
# Today — YYYY-MM-DD

N new roles found. M survived screening.

## Worth evaluating
1. **Company** — Role
   url · source · duration · why it ranks

## Also live
...

## Screened out
- **Company** — Role — gate: stated language ("maîtrise du français")
```

Keep it scannable. Recommend **at most two or three** for full evaluation. Everything else stays
in the pipeline.

## Rules that exist because of real mistakes

- **Never present raw output as a short-list.** Unfiltered feeds surface senior roles for a
  junior search. Filter seniority before showing anything.
- **Never gate on contract duration.** A shorter-than-preferred contract is a flag and a
  demotion. It is the user's decision, not the filter's.
- **Never screen out on a soft preference.** Only the gates above kill a role. "Ideally",
  "a plus", "nice to have" are BONUS and stay in the digest.
- **Dedup against the tracker, not just the scan history.** A role already at Applied must never
  reappear.
- **Do not assume a scheduled scan ran.** Check the newest timestamp in your source before
  claiming the data is fresh. A silently broken scheduled job once made a stale pipeline look
  current for weeks.
