# Application Package

The full pipeline for one role: evaluate honestly, build only if it is worth building, verify
everything, log it, and hand it to the human to send.

**This skill never submits an application.** It prepares. The human sends.

## Prerequisite

Run **`jd-analyser`** first, before loading anything else. It separates stated requirements from
post-hire responsibilities and returns the positioning brief. Build from that brief, not from
your own read of the JD.

Skipping this step is how a role that exists to *train* someone gets mis-built as a role that
requires an expert.

## Files this skill expects

```
facts.md                  the only source of claimable facts
profile.yml               constraints, exclusions, deal-breakers
applications.tsv          the tracker
reports/                  one report per evaluated role
output/cvs/               cv-<slug>.tex and .pdf
output/cover-letters/     cl-<slug>.tex and .pdf
```

Scaffold from `examples/` if these do not exist. Never invent the user's background to fill a gap.

## Workflow

### 1. Quick score, immediately

One line, before any other work:

`**<Company> — <Role>. X/5.** <one-sentence reason>`

Then stop and wait. Do not build documents until the user says go. Most roles should not be
built, and finding that out in ten seconds is the point.

### 2. Verify the posting is actually live

Never trust a search result or a cached link. Open the posting. A page showing only a navbar and
a footer means the role is closed — mark it discarded and stop.

Prefer a real browser or a scraping tool over a plain fetch; most job boards render client-side
and a naive fetch returns an empty shell that looks like a dead posting when it is not.

### 3. Write the evaluation report

`reports/{NNN}-{company-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`, in blocks:

| Block | Contents |
|---|---|
| **A. Role** | Company, title, location, duration, contract, source URL, date checked |
| **B. Requirements** | The BAR table from `jd-analyser`, with per-item verdicts |
| **C. Evidence map** | Which `facts.md` line backs which requirement |
| **D. Gaps** | Honest, specific, named. **This is the only place gaps are ever written down** |
| **E. Score** | The number, the arithmetic behind it, and the deal-breaker check |
| **F. Positioning** | The four-line brief the documents must be built from |
| **G. Recommendation** | build / don't build / need info first |

**Block D is internal.** Gaps live in the report, for the user's own judgement. They never
appear in the CV or the cover letter. When a JD exposes a real gap, the answer is to find a
genuinely stronger proof point, not to write an apologetic paragraph about the weak one.

### 4. Build the documents

Hand off to **`cv-tailor`**, which loads **`human-voice`** before writing a bullet. Both are
mandatory, every build. Working from memory on voice is a documented failure, not a theoretical one.

### 5. Verify, and state the numbers

Run `cv-tailor`'s ATS pass and `human-voice`'s Part 2 scan. Then report actual results:

> "1 page. All six headings found in order. 0 hidden characters. plain/layout delta 0.
> 4 of 4 JD terms backed by facts.md. 0 banned terms. 0 em-dashes."

Never write "should be fine" or "looks good". Either you ran the check and have a number, or you
did not run it and say so.

### 6. Add the tracker row

`applications.tsv` is tab-separated, one row per application:

```
num	date	company	role	source	url	status	score	report
```

**The `num` column is the tracker's own next row — max(num) + 1.** It is *not* the report's
number. Reusing a report number here silently overwrites an unrelated row, which is a real bug
that has happened. Read the file, find the max, add one.

Statuses, and only these: `Evaluated` · `Applied` · `Screening` · `Interview` · `Offer` ·
`Rejected` · `Withdrawn` · `Discarded`.

### 7. Present, do not send

Show the user: the score, the report path, both PDF paths, the verification numbers, and the
honest gaps. Then stop.

## Standing rules

- **Fabrication is the cardinal sin.** A fact not in `facts.md` does not go on a document, ever.
  If a JD names a tool the user genuinely uses but `facts.md` does not list, **update `facts.md`
  first, then the CV.** Never the other way round. That ordering is what prevents drift, and it
  exists because reversing it has caused real bugs twice.
- **Quality over volume.** One properly verified package beats five rushed ones. A day that
  produced five mediocre applications and no verification is a bad day.
- **Never submit autonomously**, even if asked to "just send them all".
- **Convert relative dates to absolute** everywhere. "Last Tuesday" is useless in six months.
